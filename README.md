## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed various demographic variables such as age, gender, location, and socioeconomic factors. Based on the insights gained from the analysis, personalized marketing strategies, tailored product recommendations, and targeted customer experiences will be developed for each segment. The effectiveness of these strategies will be evaluated by measuring customer satisfaction, retention rates, and revenue generated from each segment. The insights gained from this research will empower businesses to better understand their customers, refine their marketing approaches, and ultimately drive sustainable growth and success in the e-commerce industry.
